# Attachment Flow Cleanup - Summary

**Date:** February 6, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## 🧹 What Was Removed

### Deleted Files (3)

1. **`N8NAttachmentController.java`** ❌
   - Reason: Replaced by `MultimodalN8NChatController` for multimodal flow
   - Old endpoints: `/v1/api/n8n/attachments/*`
   - New endpoints: `/v1/api/n8n/multimodal/attachments/*`

2. **`N8NAttachmentService.java`** ❌
   - Reason: Replaced by `MultimodalAttachmentService`
   - Old functionality: Single file handling with Base64
   - New functionality: Vector store integration with vectorIds

3. **`N8NChatRequest.java`** ❌
   - Reason: Replaced by `MultimodalN8NRequest`
   - Old structure: Sent full file data to N8N
   - New structure: Sends only vectorIds to N8N

## 🔄 Changes to Existing Code

### GenericN8NService.java

**Removed:**
- ❌ `sendMessageWithAttachments()` method
- ❌ Old attachment processing in `executeWebhook()`
- ❌ `buildJsonBodyWithAttachments()` helper
- ❌ `sendWithoutAttachments()` fallback method
- ❌ Dependency on `N8NAttachmentService`
- ❌ Unused imports: `Attachment`, `IOException`

**Simplified:**
- ✅ `sendMessage()` - Now text-only, no attachment handling
- ✅ `executeWebhook()` - Only sends form data (text messages)
- ✅ Constructor - Only requires `GenericWebClient` and `MultimodalAttachmentService`

**Kept:**
- ✅ `sendMultimodalMessage()` - For multimodal requests with vectorIds
- ✅ `buildHeaders()` - For HTTP headers
- ✅ `buildFormDataAsStringMap()` - For text-only form data
- ✅ `buildChatResponse()` - For response building

### AnonymousUserChatN8NController.java

**Removed:**
- ❌ `/chat/with-attachments` endpoint
- ❌ Old attachment handling code
- ❌ `N8NChatRequest` import

**Kept:**
- ✅ `/chat` endpoint - For text-only messages
- ✅ Basic message handling

### AuthenticatedUserChatN8NController.java

**Removed:**
- ❌ `/chat/with-attachments` endpoint
- ❌ Old attachment handling code
- ❌ `getSessionId()` unused method
- ❌ `N8NChatRequest` import

**Kept:**
- ✅ `/chat` endpoint - For text-only messages
- ✅ Chat history endpoints
- ✅ Basic message handling

## 📋 New Multimodal-Only Flow

### Endpoints

**Text Messages (No Attachments):**
```
POST /v1/api/n8n/anonymous/chat
POST /v1/api/n8n/authenticated/chat
```

**Multimodal Messages (With Attachments):**
```
POST /v1/api/n8n/multimodal/anonymous/chat
POST /v1/api/n8n/multimodal/authenticated/chat
```

**Multimodal Attachment Management:**
```
GET    /v1/api/n8n/multimodal/attachments/{chatbotId}
GET    /v1/api/n8n/multimodal/attachments/{chatbotId}/{vectorId}
DELETE /v1/api/n8n/multimodal/attachments/{chatbotId}/{vectorId}
```

## 🔀 Migration Path

### Old Non-Multimodal Flow (Removed)
```
Client → API → Webhook
         (sends full file data)
```

### New Text-Only Flow (Simplified)
```
Client → API → N8N Webhook
         (sends only message text)
```

### New Multimodal Flow (Recommended for Files)
```
Client → API → Vector Store → N8N Webhook
         (stores file)      (sends vectorId)
```

## 📊 Code Reduction

| Component | Before | After | Change |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| N8N Services | 2 | 1 | -50% |
| Controllers | 3 | 2 | -33% |
| DTOs for Attachment | 2 | 1 | -50% |
| Total Files | 10+ | 7 | -30% |

## 🧪 Testing

### Text-Only Messages (Should Still Work)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/api/n8n/anonymous/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "role": "user",
    "message": "Hello!",
    "sessionId": "session_123",
    "chatbotId": "bot_456"
  }'
```

### Multimodal Messages (New Flow)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/api/n8n/multimodal/anonymous/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Analyze this",
    "attachments": [{...base64 file...}],
    "sessionId": "session_123",
    "chatbotId": "bot_456"
  }'
```

## ⚠️ What Users Need to Know

### If Using Text Messages
✅ No changes needed  
✅ `/chat` endpoints work as before  

### If Using Attachments
⚠️ Must migrate to `/multimodal/chat` endpoints  
⚠️ Attachments stored in vector store (better performance)  
⚠️ Receive vectorIds instead of processing raw files
